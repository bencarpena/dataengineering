# Data Engineering and Benchmarking in Oil & Gas

## Abstract
The energy transition is just another disruption which allows companies to transform and be more dynamic. Becoming a better, efficient, and responsible energy company in a carbon-intensive business has become an imperative and competitive advantage. Data is a key enabler of of this transformation. This op-ed aims to guide data engineers and IT solution architects to develop benchmarking solutions that harness the power of data and effectively democratize their consumption.

## Background
Industries measure their performance. You cannot improve what you cannot measure. From operating costs, development cycle time, reserves and fugitive emissions, the energy industry has collected a ton of data related to these metrics. However, the challenge has always been publishing & consuming data to make informed decisions. The accompanying data operations (data ops) activities such as collecting, inspecting, analyzing, integrating, applying Machine Learning, and serving the data all add up to clamor for an efficient data pipeline. Today, the
